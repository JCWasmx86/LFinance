## Contribute Code

Have a look at the [open tasks](https://github.com/JCWasmx86/LFinance/projects/1) or [issues](https://github.com/JCWasmx86/LFinance/issues).
Furthermore there are a lot of FIXME's and TODO's in the source code, that are often good first issues to resolve.

## Contribute Art

The icon of LFinance is my first attempt at working with inkscape, so it looks accordingly. I thought of an eye with a dollar sign in the middle or a telescope looking at a dollar sign.

## General

Report issues, feature requests or show room for improvements especially regarding the [GNOME Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.gnome.org/hig/) and accessibility.
